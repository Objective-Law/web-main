    <h1>About the Objective Law Initiative</h1>
    <p>Defending individual rights through principled legal advocacy grounded in Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism.</p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>The Objective Law Initiative (OLI) is a legal advocacy organization dedicated to applying Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism to law. We seek to reintroduce principled legal reasoning into American jurisprudence—placing individual rights and objective law at the center of legal discourse, judicial review, and public understanding.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We file amicus curiae briefs in precedent-setting appellate and Supreme Court cases that expose the crisis of non-objective law.</li>
        <li>We create public-facing content—including essays, videos, and op-eds—to amplify the cultural reach of our legal arguments.</li>
        <li>We convene symposia and scholarly roundtables to foster rigorous intellectual exchange and mentorship.</li>
        <li>We collaborate with like-minded liberty-oriented legal organizations, while maintaining our uncompromising philosophical foundation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
      <p>Unlike most legal organizations, we are idea-bound, not issue-bound. Our arguments are guided by moral principle and philosophical clarity, not partisan expediency or case-by-case tactics. We believe that law must be grounded in reason and serve one purpose: the objective protection of individual rights.</p>
      <p>We do not represent parties in cases, which frees us from the tactical constraints of client representation. This allows us to frame legal issues around fundamental principles, rather than procedural posture or litigation risk. Our briefs prioritize clarity, philosophy, and long-range impact.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>How We Approach Precedent</h2>
      <p>We respect the role of precedent in a common law system, but we do not treat it as a substitute for moral and constitutional principle. Our briefs acknowledge relevant precedent, while framing our arguments in terms of fundamental rights and rational legal interpretation. We work to highlight the consonance between Objectivist principles and the best of America’s constitutional heritage—particularly the Founders’ understanding of government as a protector of individual rights, not a dispenser of privileges.</p>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Outputs & Outcomes</h2>
      <p>In Year One, our deliverables will include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>4–5 amicus briefs filed in high-profile federal appellate or Supreme Court cases</li>
        <li>Accompanying articles, interviews, and explainer videos for each brief</li>
        <li>Launch of a public-facing website and communication platform</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In future years, we intend to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Expand our team of staff attorneys and scholars</li>
        <li>Launch an Objectivist legal fellowship program</li>
        <li>Host legal-philosophical conferences and public events</li>
        <li>Publish in scholarly journals and mainstream outlets</li>
        <li>Engage in original strategic litigation where appropriate</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Why Culture Matters</h2>
      <p>Legal change does not occur in a vacuum—it follows and reinforces philosophical and cultural shifts. By pairing legal strategy with cultural commentary, we aim to affect both the courtroom and the conversation. The fate of individual rights hinges on how law is understood and valued by thinkers, writers, and ultimately, the public.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <p><strong>Is this just another libertarian legal group?</strong><br/>No. While we may share some legal goals with liberty-oriented groups, our methodology and mission are unique. We begin with fundamental principles and aim to change how law itself is conceived—not just which laws get challenged.</p>
      <p><strong>Are your arguments persuasive in court?</strong><br/>While we don’t expect our briefs to immediately change case outcomes, they are crafted to be clear, professional, and philosophically rigorous—framed in a way that courts can engage with seriously. Our long-term strategy is to shift legal discourse over time by reintroducing objective standards into judicial reasoning. We aim to influence how courts, law clerks, and legal scholars think, and ultimately hope our work will be cited in judicial opinions, law reviews, and academic scholarship.</p>
      <p><strong>Are you affiliated with other Objectivist organizations?</strong><br/>We are fully independent, but we share a philosophical foundation with other Objectivist institutions. We welcome opportunities to collaborate where there is mutual alignment. Our founding has been made possible by a grant from the Prometheus Foundation, which supports Objectivist initiatives worldwide.</p>
      <p><strong>Can I contribute?</strong><br/>Yes! Whether you’re a writer, lawyer, donor, or student, we welcome inquiries. Email us at <a href="mailto:info@objectivelaw.org">info@objectivelaw.org</a>.</p>
