    <h1>About the Objective Law Initiative</h1>
    <p>Legal advocacy dedicated to objective law and individual rights, rooted in Ayn Rand's philosophy.</p>
  </header>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>The Objective Law Initiative (OLI) exists to strengthen American law by restoring clarity about its moral purpose: the protection of individual rights. We seek to revivify the best of the American founding tradition, not by nostalgia or radical overhaul, but by making its principles more explicit, more integrated, and more consistently applicable to modern life.</p>
      <p>We draw on Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism as a rigorous framework for understanding rights, government, and legal interpretation. But our project is not sectarian—our standard is objective law: law grounded in facts, reason, and principled limits on state power.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>What We Mean by “Objective Law”</h2>
      <p>Objective law is a legal system in which legal rules are principled, knowable, and justified by the purpose of government: the protection of individual rights. It requires that government coercion be used only under rationally defined rules, interpreted according to their proper function, and applied with due process. In this sense, objective law is the practical meaning of a government of laws, not men.</p>
      <p>The "objective" in Objective Law Initiative therefore rejects rule by the preferences of judges, politicians, activists, or majorities. Too often today, law is treated as an instrument for discretionary power. OLI works to reverse that drift by advancing legal arguments that tie doctrine back to rights, due process, and Constitutional limits.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We file amicus curiae briefs in precedent-setting appellate and Supreme Court cases where foundational principles of objective law and individual rights are at stake.</li>
        <li>We produce public-facing analyses, essays, and media content that translate legal arguments into clear moral and Constitutional terms.</li>
        <li>We collaborate with liberty-oriented legal organizations, while maintaining independent judgment and principled consistency.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As OLI grows, we intend to</p>
      <ul>
        <li>expand our team of staff attorneys and scholars</li>
        <li>develop a legal fellowship and mentorship pipeline</li>
        <li>host legal-philosophical conferences and public events, including symposia and scholarly roundtables to foster rigorous intellectual exchange</li>
        <li>publish in scholarly journals and mainstream outlets</li>
        <li>engage in original strategic litigation where appropriate</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Culture Matters</h2>
      <p>Legal change does not occur in a vacuum—it follows and reinforces philosophical and cultural shifts. By pairing legal strategy with cultural commentary, we aim to affect both the courtroom and the conversation. The fate of individual rights hinges on how law is understood and valued by thinkers, writers, and ultimately, the public.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
      <p>OLI is a horizontal legal-philosophical initiative. Many excellent organizations work vertically in specific domains. For example, groups like <a href="https://www.thefire.org" target="_blank">FIRE (Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression)</a>, <a href="https://ij.org" target="_blank">IJ (Institute for Justice)</a>, and <a href="https://pacificlegal.org/" target="_blank"> PLF (Pacific Legal Foundation)</a> have built powerful issue-specific programs. OLI complements that work by advancing a unifying jurisprudential framework that can be applied across domains.</p>
      <p>We are principle-first, not tribe-first. We do not tailor our legal theory to the demands of partisan cycles. We work to articulate rights-respecting legal standards that courts can apply consistently across changing facts, technologies, and political pressures.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Founding Principles, Modern Application</h2>
      <p>We reject the false alternatives that America's legal foundations should be discarded for being dated, or that they can simply be dogmatically repeated and applied without deeper grounding. The Founders got the essentials importantly right in the Constitution and Declaration, but the culture did not develop a sufficiently explicit philosophical framework to defend and apply those principles consistently over time.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to help supply that missing integration. Using Objectivism's distinctive account of rights, reason, and political morality, we aim to show how America's founding principles can be applied more coherently to contemporary realities, including novel legal conflicts created by new technologies and social conditions.</p>

      <p><strong>Nicholas Provenzo</strong> – CEO & Legal Director<br/>An attorney, writer, and longtime Objectivist, Nicholas brings decades of legal advocacy experience and philosophical insight to the initiative. A former FedSoc chapter leader and legal fellow, he is responsible for the legal vision, authorship of briefs, coalition strategy, and public positioning of OLI’s mission. He previously served in senior roles at a national right-to-work legal foundation and has published in legal and philosophical outlets.</p>
      <p><strong>Arthur Zey</strong> – COO<br/>Arthur brings a unique blend of legal, operational, and philosophical experience to the team. He holds a JD from UCLA School of Law, is admitted to the California Bar, and is a graduate of the Objectivist Academic Center. He previously founded and led a 501(c)(3) Objectivist student organization and has worked extensively in executive roles at technology companies, ranging from startups to multinational corporations, including Twitter, Autodesk, Amazon, and Ookla. Primarily a product manager, his work has involved coordinating engineering, design, marketing, legal, business strategy, and leadership teams, conducting user research, refining product strategy, and managing QA and testing pipelines. At the Ayn Rand Institute, he helped design and implement tools to streamline the management of OCON, ARI’s summer conference, giving him direct experience with the operational demands of Objectivist intellectual events.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <p><strong>Is this just another libertarian legal group?</strong><br/>No. We share some goals with liberty-oriented organizations, but our defining focus is jurisprudential: objective standards of legal interpretation grounded in individual rights.</p>
      <p><strong>Are you non-partisan?</strong><br/>Yes. Our standard is not party alignment, but individual rights. We evaluate legal issues by whether they protect rights under objective legal principles, which means our conclusions may sometimes align with positions associated with either the right or the left.</p>
      <p><strong>Do you believe in "judicial activism"?</strong><br/>We reject the standard activism-versus-restraint framing when it is used to avoid first-order questions of legal principle. Courts should neither legislate from the bench nor abdicate their role by mechanically deferring to government power. Proper judging requires active-minded interpretation: identifying the governing principles of rights and applying them objectively to concrete cases, including novel modern contexts.</p>
      <p><strong>How do you reconcile your approach with the role of precedent?</strong><br/>We respect precedent as an institutional reality and legal constraint, but we do not treat it as a substitute for principle. Our approach is to identify the fundamental rights at stake, engage doctrine seriously, and argue for interpretations that preserve objective legal standards and Constitutional limits.</p>
      <p><strong>Are your arguments persuasive in court?</strong><br/>While we don't expect our briefs to immediately change case outcomes, they are crafted to be clear, professional, and philosophically rigorous—framed in a way that courts can engage with seriously. Our long-term strategy is to shift legal discourse over time by reintroducing objective standards into judicial reasoning. We aim to influence how courts, law clerks, and legal scholars think, and ultimately hope our work will be cited in judicial opinions, law reviews, and academic scholarship.</p>
      <p><strong>Is "objective law" just another word for Objectivism?</strong><br/>No. "Objective law" names the legal ideal itself: law independent of personal whim and constrained by reason and rights. Objectivism is the philosophical framework that helps us explain and defend that legal ideal.</p>
      <p><strong>Are you affiliated with other Objectivist organizations?</strong><br/>We are fully independent, though we share philosophical common ground with many scholars and institutions in the broader liberty movement.</p>
      <p><strong>Can I contribute?</strong><br/>Yes. We welcome inquiries from donors, legal professionals, writers, researchers, and volunteers. Email us at <a href="mailto:info@objectivelaw.org">info@objectivelaw.org</a>.</p>
